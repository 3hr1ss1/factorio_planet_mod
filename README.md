# Mithra - a Factorio Planet Mod
A factorio mod for our Software development Subject.

## Concept
Mithra is a desert-like planet on the fourth ring of the Factorio solar system. There is barely anything more than sand, sun and vicious creatures. But those who can make sand and sun their own will unlock new resources and buildings such as “short-handed inserter”, “solar ovens” and “basic fluid pumps”.

## Contents

### Flora and Fauna
- New planet (desert)
- New mobs and spawners
- New plants (cacti, dead bush)
- A moving storm, damaging buildings and players over time

### Ressource Gaining
- Gaining **energy** by using solar
- Gaining **wood** by harvesting dead bush
- Gaining **coarse sand** by mining anywhere
- Gaining **silicon dust** by mining silicon deposit

### Products
- Gaining **stone, fine sand** by sieving **coarse sand**
- Gaining **copper ore, iron ore** by washing **fine sand**
- Gaining **glass** by smelting **fine sand**
- Gaining **silicon ingot** by smelting **silicon dust**
